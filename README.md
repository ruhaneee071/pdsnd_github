### Project Title
Bikeshare data analysis

### Description

### Overview
This project will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

Software requirement?
=> Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
=> A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
=> A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

How to run the script
This script is written in Python 3 and uses pandas, numpy and time packages. You will need all of these packages and Python 3 to be able to launch the script. 
Run bikeshare.py file from your terminal and you will see a prompt that will guide your experience reviewing the bikeshare data and reading relevant data analysis. 

download the bikehsare folder onto your computer
open terminal
navigate to the location of your bikeshare folder
type the following into terminal / python bikeshare.py /

Bike Share Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

This project will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. 

The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year

Statistics Computed
In this project, following questions will be answered using python:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration
total travel time
average travel time

#4 User info
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
